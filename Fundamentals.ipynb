    "####  Origin Story\n",
    "\n",
    "Picture the early 2000s, when there was a need to develop ML frameworks that were flexible enough for daily research tasks. Out of this need, the Torch framework was born. Torch was released in 2002 out of the efforts of Ronan Collobert, Koray Kavukcuoglu, and Clement Farabet. It was later picked up by Facebook AI Research and many other people from several universities and research groups. Although Torch did give the required flexibility, it was written in Lua, which was not a very popular language, and the major drawback the community faced was the learning curve to the new language. \n",
    "\n",
    "The widespread acceptance of Pyhon in the ML community made the developers pivot to Python, and thus the Python based version of Torch a.k.a PyTorch was born. PyTorch began as an internship project by Adam Paszke, who was working under Soumith Chintala, a core developer of Torch.\n",

    "PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that allows you to write your own neural networks and optimize them efficiently. It was primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research Lab (FAIR). It is based on the Torch library, which is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine learning algorithms. PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:\n",
    "* A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs and other accelerators.\n",
    "* An automatic differentiation library that is useful to implement neural networks."

    "Tensors are the basic building blocks of modern deep learning frameworks. A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices and is easily understood as a multidimensional array. A tensor can be a number, a vector, a matrix, or an n-dimensional array, or in general terms a container storing numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended viewing to understand tensors: What's a Tensor? - Dan Fleisch (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5liqUk0ZTw)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Types of Tensor:\n",
    "* Scalar / 0-D tensor: A container with a single value. (Ex: 23, 5, 2, etc)\n",
    "* Vector / 1-D tensor: A container with multiple values. (Ex: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "* Matrix / 2-D tensor: A container with multiple values arranged in rows and columns. (Ex: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\n",
    "* In general, 2-D tensors are called matrices (Matrix, if singular), and anything above 2-D are just called tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Rank of a Tensor:\n",
    "\n",
    "A tensor of rank 1 is a vector, which is a one-dimensional array, \n",
    "```python\n",
    "[a,b]\n",
    "```\n",
    "A tensor of rank 2 is a vector of vectors, or a matrix, or a two-dimensional array,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[[a,b],[c,d]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "A tensor of rank 3 is a vector of vectors of vectors, so something with three nestings,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[[[a,b],[c,d]],[[e,f],[g,h]]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "and so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, a tensor can be understood to be a vector of vectors of vectors of vectors... and so on. The rank is the number of nestings of \"of vectors\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Or in other words, Rank can be described as the number of information needed to specify a particular element of a tensor. For example, to specify an element in a 2-D tensor, we need 2 pieces of information, the row and the column. So, the rank of a 2-D tensor is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pitfall:\n",
    "##### Are Matrices and 2-D tensors the same?    \n",
    "\n",
    "A 2-D tensor can be represented by a matrix, but there is more to a tensor than just its arrangement of numerical values. A tensor is a geometric object, whose components obey certain transformation laws. A matrix is just a collection of numbers in a rectangular array, there's no inherent rule that they have to obey any transformation rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Video is a series of images correlated over time. We can use tensors to represent that correlation better and more intuitively than trying to convert it down to two-dimensional matrices. A third-rank tensor can encode all the aspects of each image (height, width, and color), while a rank-4 tensor could also hold information about time or order for the images."
